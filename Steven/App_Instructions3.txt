I made additions to the following files:

app.py
dummy.py
tabledef.py
tutorial.db
login.html

I added the following files:

upload.html
signup.html

The program can be run in localhost:5001

Navigate to the folder where you have app.py and run it with the command:
python app.py

Put the .html files in the template folder as before and the .css files go in the static folder as before.

Let me know if you have any questions.
