Jaspal
- Train Inception-v3 using tutorial data
- Investigate 
  a) Model parameters w.r.t. size of input (i.e. image dimensions) and output (i.e. classification/probability. The professor mentioned the output is normalized using parameter 'activation fraction' and setting it to to 'softmax'
  b) How the website can handle requests sent to and responses received from the model. For example, do we need a running instance of the model up at all times or can it be a simple script that's initiated everytime a user requests an image to be classified?
