# Weekly Reports

### Instructions for tracking our weekly progress:
1. Every Tuesday we will discuss the work we agree to do for the week. 
2. Andrew will copy this information to the corresponding Week#.txt file
3. At the end of the week, please mark each work item DONE.
  - e.g. "- Train Inception-v3 using tutorial images. (DONE)"
4. The work marked 'DONE' will be uploaded to CUNY Blackboard as part of our weekly progress report.
5. Whatever is not marked 'DONE' will be rolled over into next week's work plan.
