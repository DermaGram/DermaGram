In order to create your database, run mysql
at the mysql command line run: 
msql> source /path/to/dbScript.sql

Then edit the db.py file to match your username and password on your localhost. 
If you want to create a separate user for the db, run within mysql: 
mysql> CREATE USER 'new_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'new_password';

then do: 
mysql> GRANT ALL ON my_db.* TO 'new_user'@'localhost';
