For week two, I have done some research on possible encryption algorithms that I could create to protect our user's information. In the end, I decided that simply using mysql's premade encryptions would be best. I need a bit more time next week to set up the encryption in the database as there are many options to choose from and I need to learn which would be best for needs. 
I also decided to work on the database for the website. In order to first visualize what would be needed, I drew up a schema diagram for the database. Then, I wrote a script to create the needed tables. I decided to write a script as it would be easy for another member in the group to recreate it on their own local host. I then ran the script on my machine and debugged it.
